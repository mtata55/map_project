# Build a Google Maps Website

## Description
Source code for a Google Maps Website.

This project is part of the Udacity full stack Nanodegree program and requires preparation of a single page website containing a Google maps area along with a list of locations.
The map area has google maps markers corresponding to the locations in the list. A search bar allows for filtering of both the locations list and markers based on title. Clicking on a marker / a location in the list opens an infowindow on the marker which pulls a text extract and photo for the location from Wikipedia and also provides a link to the actual page.

Built using the Knockout framework, Google Maps API and Wikipedia API.
